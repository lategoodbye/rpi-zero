title: BCM2835 DMA controller

maintainers:

description: |
  The BCM2835 DMA controller has 16 channels in total.
  Only the lower 13 channels have an associated IRQ.
  Some arbitrary channels are used by the firmware
  (1,3,6,7 in the current firmware version).
  The channels 0,2 and 3 have special functionality
  and should not be used by the driver.

      DMA clients must use the format described in dma.txt, giving a phandle
      to the DMA controller while the second cell in the dmas property of the
      client device represents the DREQ number.
