Customer OTP Memory for Raspberry Pi

The VC4 firmware exposes a mailbox interface that allows the ARM core
to access the customer part of the OTP memory.

The OTP node must be a child node of the Raspberry Pi firmware node.

Required properties :
- compatible     : Should be "raspberrypi,bcm2835-customer-otp"

See nvmem.txt for more information.

Example:

firmware: firmware-rpi {
	compatible = "raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware";
	mboxes = <&mailbox>;

	customer_otp: otp {
		compatible = "raspberrypi,bcm2835-customer-otp";
	};
};
